# E-Commerce Website Project

This repository contains my first e-commerce website project aimed at showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SCSS. The website is inspired by the exquisite creations of Jacob & Co., particularly the awe-inspiring BUGATTI CHIRON TOURBILLON SAPPHIRE CRYSTAL CLEAR watch.

## About the Project

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in front-end web development. I aimed to create a responsive website that functions flawlessly across various devices, including PCs, iPads, iPhones, and other devices. Through this project, I have honed my skills in:

- **HTML**: Structuring the web pages with semantic HTML5 elements.
- **CSS**: Styling the website using CSS, focusing on responsiveness and aesthetics.
- **JavaScript**: Implementing interactive elements and enhancing user experience.
- **SCSS**: Utilizing SCSS for more efficient and maintainable styling.

## Website Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Product Showcase**: The website features a showcase of Jacob & Co.'s BUGATTI CHIRON TOURBILLON SAPPHIRE CRYSTAL CLEAR watch, displaying its unique features and design.
- **Navigation**: Intuitive navigation for easy exploration of the site's content.
- **Interactive Elements**: Implementation of JavaScript for interactive elements and improved user engagement.
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Tested and optimized for various devices to ensure a consistent user experience.
